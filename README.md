STOCKEY SINATRA PROJECT

Stockey is a website that allows users to read, add, edit, and delete stocks of their choosing.  I have included some recommended stocks for the user to view, and the ability to create their own stock to track its price.  The idea behind this project was to create a social media platform built around discussing stocks, and this is so far just the framework of what I want it to be.  Eventually, I will include an API with real-time stock pricing and forums for users to discuss their stock moves.

Prerequisites: To be safe, you will need the latest version of Ruby. The bundler/setup should take care of most of what you need, but to be safe, you'll need to have access to the gems in the bundler.

Installation

Go to the following link to find the code for this project:

git@github.com:Rollo510/stockey.git

Open with your choice of text editor. Type "bundle install" in command line to install gems.  Next, run "shotgun" in the terminal to set up a local server, then navigate to your local server address (localhost:9393) to display the website.
